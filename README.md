# risk_troop_left_calculator
calculates the troop loss for True Random

if there is someone who would like to push modifications for Balanced Blitz or just to accomodate zombies or better UI, pls go for it

download the .exe file in dist/risk_calc.exe, 

should be able to run on normal office desktop settings

its pretty slow and just click 'submit' once, dont worry if it says not responding, because at higher numbers like 600 v 222, it will run pretty slow (depending on your CPU)
